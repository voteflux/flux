# Flux Party (NSW) - Constitution

## Introduction

This is the constitution for the New South Wales political party named "Flux Party (NSW)", sometimes referred to as "Flux NSW" or "The Party" in this document.

Flux NSW has no registered abbreviation at the time of registration.
Flux NSW is a state party associated with the federal party "VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy!" with the abbreviation "Flux".

The term "Flux AUS" is used to refer to the federal Flux Party, not the state party.

Flux Party (NSW) is hereby established as an organization.

The canonical version of the constitution is stored in the repository at https://github.com/voteflux/flux/ under the file name ’CONSTITUTION.NSW.md’


Clauses should be referred to by line number and most recent commit hash.

Flux NSW intends to defer some of the responsibilities for running the party to the federal Flux party, and this is indicated in this document.

**This document is ratified when the federal Flux constitution is updated to reflect this fact.**
This will be recorded under the section titled "State and Territory Branches".
At the time of writing this link will take an observer to said ratification: https://github.com/voteflux/flux/blob/master/CONSTITUTION.md#state-and-territory-branches

## Objective

The primary objective of Flux NSW is to promote the election of endorsed candidates to the Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council of New South Wales.

Further objectives:

* To provide every New South Wales voter with real democratic potential.

* To provide the framework and means for minor parties and independents to participate productively without winning a seat.
* To facilitate a culture of engagement through empowering specialists and passionate voters;
* To stimulate the creation of new policy options.

Flux NSW also adopts objectives of the federal Flux party where possible.

* Flux NSW must provide Declarations of Membership Forms to the New South Wales Electoral Commission for each of the 750 members who are relied upon for registration of the party.

### Membership

All New South Wales electors are eligible for membership.
They may join Flux NSW by joining the federal Flux party. Membership applications are submitted through Flux AUS's website, at https://voteflux.org; members may opt out of inclusion of state or federal membership through the website membership portal.  Membership to Flux NSW is automatic for qualified applicants registering for Flux AUS.  Each member is required to provide their name, address, and date of birth such that it matches the electoral roll.  Other contact details which are optional, include; email address (required for party correspondence), and phone number.  Membership is free, there is only one category of membership, and members are always referred to as 'members'.

Members retain membership by retaining membership to the federal Flux party. There are no obligations outside of maintaining membership.

Members may resign or revoke their membership through the resignation feature on the member's membership details page.

Elected candidates that are members of Flux NSW are not permitted to be members of other political parties.  Should a Flux candidate find themselves a member of a secondary party, they must immediately resign, so as to retain only one party affiliation. 

Members may be expelled or suspended from the party when it is agreed upon unanimously by the Leadership.

#### Annual General Meeting

The party is required to hold Annual General Meetings (AGMs) once per calendar year at a time of the Leadership's choosing.

The rules around AGMs (except those above) are identical in an ongoing basis to the section titled "Annual General Meeting" in the federal Flux constitution.

## Amendments to this Constitution

Constitutional amendments are to be submitted via pull request to the relevant Github repository.

## Endorsed Candidates

Endorsed candidates are chosen by The Leader or by a quorum, though any candidates chosen by a quorum can be vetoed by the Leader.

## Internal Voting System

Flux NSW will use an internal voting system to

* Facilitate all New South Wales electors participating in the democratic process. Once a Flux NSW candidate is elected;
* Facilitate members participating in the democratic process.
* Facilitate minor parties and independents' productive participation without winning a seat.

The parameters and design choices of the system are left to the Leader, and not within the scope of this document.  There is no requirement that the voting system for members is the same as the voting system for minor parties.  This voting system may be provided by the federal Flux party's voting system, though in this case participation for New South Wales specific issues is restricted to New South Wales electors.
