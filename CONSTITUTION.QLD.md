Preselection amendments are to be approved by the Steering Committee and reflected in the constitutional iteration committed by September 30th, 2020; the quarterly report to the Electoral Commission Queensland will reflect these changes.

## Internal Voting System

Flux QLD will use an internal voting system to:

* Facilitate members participating in the democratic process.
* Facilitate minor parties and independents' productive participation without winning a seat.

The parameters and design choices of the system are left to the Leader, and not within the scope of this document.  There is no requirement that the voting system for members is the same as the voting system for minor parties.  This voting system may be provided by the federal Flux party's voting system, though in this case participation for Queensland specific issues is restricted to Queensland electors.
