# The Flux Party — WA Constitution

## Introduction

This is the constitution for the WA political party named "The Flux Party — WA", sometimes referred to as "Flux WA" or "The Party" in this document.
The registered abbreviation for the party at the time of registration is "Flux The System! Flux Party WA".
It is a branch of the federal party "VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy!" with the abbreviation "Flux".
The term "Flux AUS" is used to refer to the federal Flux Party, not the state party.

The Flux Party — WA is hereby established as an organisation.

The canonical version of the constitution is stored in the repository at https://github.com/voteflux/flux/ under the file name `CONSTITUTION.WA.md`.


Clauses should be referred to by line number and most recent commit hash.

Flux WA intends to defer many of the responsibilities for running the party to the federal Flux party, and this is indicated in this document.

This document is ratified when the federal Flux constitution is updated to reflect this fact.
This will be recorded under the section titled "State and Territory Branches".
At the time of writing this link will take an observer to said ratification: https://github.com/voteflux/flux/blob/master/CONSTITUTION.md

## Objective

The primary objective of Flux WA is to promote the election of endorsed candidates to the Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council of Western Australia.
Promotion and endorsement of candidates will be contextually appropriate.

Further objectives:

* To provide every WA voter with real democratic potential
* To use elected candidates as a gateway for electors to directly influence the Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council within Australian law, using an internal voting system
* To provide the framework and means for minor parties and independents to participate productively without winning a seat
