# Flux Constitution

## Introduction

This is the constitution for the political party known as "VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy!", sometimes referred to as "Flux" or "the party" in this document.

Flux is hereby established as an organization.

The canonical version of the constitution is stored in the repository at https://github.com/voteflux/flux/

Clauses should be referred to by line number and most recent commit hash.

## Objective

The primary objective of Flux is to promote the election of endorsed candidates to the Senate and House of Representatives. 
Promotion and endorsement of candidates will be contextually appropriate.

Further objectives:

* To provide every Australian voter with real democratic potential
* To use elected parliamentarians as a gateway for members to directly influence parliament within Australian law, using an internal voting system
* To provide the framework and means for minor parties and independents to participate productively without winning a seat
* To facilitate a culture of criticism through empowering specialists and passionate voters
* To stimulate the creation of new policy options

## Membership Criteria

-Flux's membership criteria are:
-
-* Maintain a list of at least 500 members who are on the Australian electoral roll
-* or, Have at least 1 member who is a parliamentarian

### Membership

All Australian citizens and permanent residents are eligible for membership. 
There is no cost for membership.
Each member is required to provide their name and address. If the member is on the electoral roll, their name and address must match that of the electoral roll. If the member is not on the electoral roll, they must indicate this in their application.
Other required details include methods of contact, an email address is required, a phone number is optional.
Their membership application is to be submitted through Flux's website, at https://voteflux.org.
Members may resign or revoke their membership through the resignation feature on the member's membership details page.

To retain membership, after at least one Flux parliamentarian has been elected, members will need to (once a year) confirm their details are up to date through an email notification.
Each time this happens their membership is valid for 1 year and they are granted voting rights within Flux's internal voting system.

There are no obligations outside of maintaining membership.

Parliamentarians who are members of Flux are not permitted to be members of other political parties.
In a case where a parliamentarian does find themselves a member of another party, they must immediately resign from that other party.

Members may be expelled from the party only in the case it is agreed upon unanimously by the Leadership, and a member who has nominated for an internal election may not be expelled until 60 days after the results of the election have been published.

## Structure of Flux and Office Bearers

### Structure and Office Bearers

Official roles of the party are:

* Leader
* Deputy Leader
* Secretary
* Party Agent
* Treasurer
* Registered Officer

There is also a group known as the Leadership described below. 
Official roles (with the exception of Leader and Deputy Leader) are chosen by the Leadership, or by the Leader as per the section on Decision Making.

#### Secretary

The Secretary is responsible for the day-to-day running of the party. 
They also have the responsibility for the carrying out of the administration, and for the conduct of the correspondence, of the party.

#### Initialization

Initially the roles will be filled as per the below:

* Leader: Max Kaye
* Deputy Leader: Nathan Spataro
* Secretary: Max Kaye
* Registered Officer: Nathan Spataro
* Treasurer: Jonathon Miller
* Party Agent: Jonathon Miller

When the party's application to the AEC is successful this constitution is comes into effect and is adopted by the party.

### The Leadership

Members of The Leadership are hand chosen by the Leader and Deputy Leader and form the support for the Leader.
They have no special roles, but form a close team to assist the Leader in managing and leading the party.

#### The Leader

Max Kaye is the initial leader. 
In the case of the death of the Leader, the Deputy Leader becomes Leader and then appoints a new Deputy Leader of their choosing.

The initial Leader shall retain that position until January 31, 2017 and is eligible for re-election.
For this period they are essentially a benevolent dictator.

If circumstances require the position of Leader to be filled but the Deputy Leader cannot take the position, the Leadership may elect a new Leader by whichever means they choose. If an impasse is reached a new Leader is randomly chosen from the Leadership.

The Leader may resign and appoint a new Leader before the expiry of their term.

##### Election of the Leader

Every year, on December 1, the Leadership must send an email to all members informing them that:
* There will be an election for the position of Leader starting 15 January; and that
* Nominations are being sought; and
* Explaining the method through which members may nominate

The Leadership may determine the method of nomination, subject to the following constraints:
* The only reason for which a person's nomination for the position of Leader may be rejected is if that person is not a member of Flux or if they have failed to provide their full name.
* The deadline for nominations is December 15
* The Leadership must accept nominations through email, post and the Flux community forum and may accept nominations through any other method, provided that all members are informed of this method
* The only information which a person must provide in their nomination is their full name and a statement that they are a member of Flux, although they must be given the opportunity to provide a contact email address, a contact phone number, a candidate statement of no more than 2500 words and a photograph of themselves.
* Within 48 hours of receiving a nomination, if the nomination is accepted, the Leadership must publish all of the above information which the candidate has chosen to provide without modification on the Flux website, and if the nomination is rejected, the Leadership must provide the nominee with the reason for the rejection and allow the nominee to re-apply.

If no valid nominations are received, the current Leader shall retain their position. If only one valid nomination is received, that person shall be declared the Leader without the need for an election. In all other cases, the below procedure should be followed.

On January 1, the Leadership must send all members who are eligible to vote in the election an email:
* Containing links to pages with all of the information that each candidate provided with their nomination; and
* Giving members any information which they require to access the voting system; and
* Informing them that the voting system will be open at all times from January 1 until January 31.

The Leadership may determine the method of voting, subject to the following constraints:
* The Flux voting system shall be used if it is available
* If the Flux voting system is unavailable, optional preferential voting shall be used
* The voting system must be available online
* The voting system must be made available at all times from January 1 until January 31.
* All members who were members on the preceding July 1 shall be eligible to vote, and no other person shall be eligible to vote

## Amendments to this Constitution

Except where otherwise specified, amendments to this constitution can be made with the support of at least 66% of a quorum, or at the discretion of the party Leader.

They are to be submitted via pull request to the relevant Github repository.

### Amendments concerning the party Leader
Amendments to the provisions of the constitution relating to the election of the party Leader, the term length of the party Leader, or to this section, may only be made with the passage of a referendum.

The Leader must hold a referendum upon the application of:
* A quorum; or
* One percent of the members; or
* 100 members
within 30 days of receiving the application, but is not obligated to if a referendum has been held within the last three months, or if the application has been withdrawn.

In counting the number of members who have applied, if one member makes more than five applications during a three month period, their support shall only be counted for their first five applications.

To make such an application, one person must make a git pull request to the Constitution containing the proposed amendment and all others making the application must add a comment indicating their support.

If the Leader has received multiple applications for a referendum, they may at their discretion choose to hold them at the same time.

In a referendum:
* The Flux voting system shall be used if it is available
* If the Flux voting system is unavailable, optional preferential voting shall be used
* The voting system must be available online
* All members who have been members for at least three months shall be eligible to vote in the referendum.
* The question to be put to voters shall be "Do you approve of the proposed change to the Constitution?", with a link provided to the diff of the proposed change, and the only possible answers shall be "yes" or "no".
* The Leader must send an email to all Flux members eligible to vote in the referendum informing them of the referendum and giving them the information required for them to access and use the voting system, and informing them that the voting system will be open for a period of 7 days
* If multiple referendums are held at the same time, and more than one of those referendums passes, the pull requests shall be applied in order of the size of the majority (e.g. 90% first, 72% second, 61% third, etc.) and if a pull request cannot be applied due to a conflict with a proposal which passed with a higher majority, it shall not be applied. If two referendums have the same size majority, then the order of application shall be determined randomly.
* For a referendum to pass, at least 60% of the voting members must approve it.

## Endorsed Candidates

Endorsed candidates are chosen by the Leader or by a quorum, though any candidates chosen by a quorum are able to be vetoed by the Leader.

## State and Territory Branches

State registered parties and branches may be created with the oversight of the Leadership.
Members may opt-out of helping to form the state branch or party if they wish.

State and Territory branches may use the name "Flux" and associated branding elements when they have been created as a subsection here, as is the case with `ACT Branch` below.

### ACT Branch

The ACT branch of the Flux party is to be established with the constitution contained in the `CONSTITUTION.ACT.md` document in the root of this repository.
This constitution can be found at: https://github.com/voteflux/flux/blob/master/CONSTITUTION.ACT.md

`CONSTITUTION.ACT.md` is accepted and ratified as the opening constitution of Flux ACT as defined in commit `c37c68126e3c9d354d8bb66496d8efd6d9b35caa` which is verified (and provided) at the following URL: https://github.com/voteflux/flux/blob/c37c68126e3c9d354d8bb66496d8efd6d9b35caa/CONSTITUTION.ACT.md (note the commit hash - the long string of randomish letters and numbers - matches the commit hash in the URL, indicating the document is correct and not tampered with).

## Internal Voting System

Flux will use an internal voting system to

* Facilitate members participating in the parliamentary process
* Facilitate minor parties and independents' productive participation without winning a seat

The parameters and design choices of the system are left to the Leader, and not within the scope of this document.
There is no requirement that the voting system for members is the same as the voting system for minor parties.
