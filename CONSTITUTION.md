## Objective

The primary objective of Flux is to promote the election of endorsed candidates to the Senate and House of Representatives.
Promotion and endorsement of candidates will be contextually appropriate.

Further objectives:

* To provide every Australian voter with real democratic potential
* To use elected parliamentarians as a gateway for members to directly influence parliament within Australian law, using an internal voting system
* To provide the framework and means for minor parties and independents to participate productively without winning a seat
* To facilitate a culture of criticism through empowering specialists and passionate voters
* To stimulate the creation of new policy options

## Membership Criteria

Flux's membership criteria are:

* Maintain a list of at least 500 members who are on the Australian electoral roll
* or, Have at least 1 member who is a parliamentarian

### Membership

All Australian voters are eligible for membership.
There is no cost for membership.
Each member is required to provide their name and address such that it matches the electoral roll.
Other required details include methods of contact, an email address is required, a phone number is optional.
Their membership application is to be submitted through Flux's website, at https://voteflux.org.
Members may resign or revoke their membership through the resignation feature on the member's membership details page.

To retain membership, after at least one Flux parliamentarian has been elected, members will need to (once a year) confirm their details are up to date through an email notification.
Each time this happens their membership is valid for 1 year and they are granted voting rights within Flux's internal voting system.

There are no obligations outside of maintaining membership.

Parliamentarians who are members of Flux are not permitted to be members of other political parties.
In a case where a parliamentarian does find themselves a member of another party, they must immediately resign from that other party.

Members may be expelled from the party only in the case it is agreed upon unanimously by the Leadership.
