Purpose 
The purpose of this policy is to ensure that all stakeholders understand their rights and obligations when engaging in public forum hosted by, or in association with the national Flux party and it's subsidiary party affiliates. We encourage mutually respectful exchanges, tolerance, and encourage the use of deliberative discussion and conscious communication methodologies.  It is important that all individual persons, members and citizens using social media (such as on-line forums, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube) understand that there are inherent risks, such as personal defamation, and each individual takes responsibility for managing the risks. 

Scope 
This policy applies to all stakeholders including Flux members, candidates, volunteers and the general public. In cases of believing one is unfairly blocked, note that our Dispute Resolution Policies can be found in the respective federal, state and/or municipal constitutions, as required. This policy covers, but is not limited to, the sites and services mentioned below, and is also intended to cover other social media services as they develop in the future:  social networking sites (eg Facebook); professional networking services (eg Linkedln); video and photo sharing websites (eg YouTube); micro-blogging (eg Twitter); forums and discussion boards (eg Google Groups); online collaborations (eg Wikipedia); podcasting; blogs. 

3.0  Definitions

Stakeholders should not: make comment as a representative of Flux unless authorised to do so. 

4.2 

Just as bullying and harassment will not be tolerated in the physical world, nor will it be tolerated where it occurs on a social media site. Please refrain from posting any offensive, obscene, bullying, discriminatory, hateful, racist, sexist, abusive, harassing, threatening or defamatory content.

5.0  Security risks 

Social media sites can contain a significant amount of personal information. Accordingly, it is in the best interests of members to ensure appropriate and effective security and/or privacy settings are maintained. Members need to be mindful that regardless of the security/privacy settings, content may still be made public (eg a contact may cut and paste comments onto another site) or may be illegally accessed by cybercriminals. Furthermore, unintended invitees may gain access to a social network site through a linked association (eg friend of a friend). Some individuals and organisations, including criminal organisations, use social media to mask their true identity and obtain personal information. It is recommended that members exercise caution with respect to the type of information that they post on such sites. 

6.0  Reporting 

Members who fail to comply with this policy may be subject to counseling and expulsion. Observers should report any breach of this policy to a Steering Committee member. The Steering Committee member is to report any breach of this policy or seek advice from Leadership.
