# Candidate Selection

Our (Max (Leader) and Nathan (Deputy Leader)) primary goal in selecting candidates is to find electable candidates who will not defect from Flux if elected. Secondary objectives are to find intelligent folk who are able to contribute to all manner of parliamentary processes (like royal commissions), are able to help build Flux into a global movement, and who are able to inspire the diversity and involvement democracy deserves.

Candidate selection is not an easy thing. There is no legal way to bind a candidates behaviour. This means extreme care needs to be taken to avoid defections. (Examples:

There are (broadly) two ways (we can think of) to keep senators with Flux if elected: social pressure and philosophical alignment.

We can use the first in a few ways; making a promise in advance (like a self-recorded video pledging to stay with Flux if elected) may help ([source](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=JN4WCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA118&lpg=PA118&dq=psychology+promising+not+to+lie+before+or+after&source=bl&ots=6cJjtsgQPL&sig=moJWoRbLSFyqBCqor26TaVIyFWA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwinxOus47TLAhWkFaYKHXJtDTIQ6AEILDAD#v=onepage&q=psychology%20promising%20not%20to%20lie%20before%20or%20after&f=false)), as well as developing strong relationships with the Flux community.

The second method is harder to test for and cultivate. Particularly, a high regard for fallabalism is required, as well as a deep appreciation for and commitment to the Flux system and its many, *subtle* properties. It is likely Flux senators will need to vote against their own opinions regularly. I believe one of the best ways to achieve this is reading and appreciating David Deutsch's breathtakingly profound work *The Beginning of Infinity* (2011) ([Book Depository](http://www.bookdepository.com/The-Beginning-of-Infinity-David-Deutsch/9780143121350?ref=grid-view), [PDF - legality unknown](http://www.pdf-archive.com/2014/06/18/the-beginning-of-infinity/the-beginning-of-infinity.pdf)). This is not the only way, but it is certainly the most direct (that I am aware of).

## Selection process

Nathan and I are refining the process where possible. Currently we're accepting expressions of interest via this [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1LhpFQipvUHKSi68EJlHcvoaR7xhCLQ0CoSCjYNhC3Rg/viewform). There is no set process, and there likely won't be one due to the overhead. We'll be talking with people individually to try and gauge how appropriate they might be. Diversity is important to us.

## Suggestions

We're open to suggestions and criticisms about this process. Please email `leadership@voteflux.org` if you'd like to discuss anything.

## Timeline

The likely timeline for candidate selection (presuming a double D):

* Applications accepted: mid Feb
* Preliminary talks: March
* Continued talks: April
* Applications close: 12 May (DD date)
* More talks: May
* Decision: Early June
* Submission to AEC: Min June
* Election: July 2

## Candidates so far

* Max Kaye
* Nathan Spataro

## Potential Attacks

There are a few attacks that can be made if we allow membership to vote on candidates. At this stage we're small and fragile which is why we're not allowing voting on candidates.

### Simple Hostile Bloc

Presume a larger group than Flux (like another party) is able to:

* Join Flux
* Nominate candidates
* Vote on candidates

The comparative size means the majority of Flux candidates would be chosen without the primary goal (above) in mind. This leads to a loss of integrity, either because the senators will defect, or remain and attempt to subvert Flux at a crucial moment.
 
### Loyalty to Bloc over Flux

Let's presume there is, say, 1/6th of Flux is essentially a faction (call it F). They nominate one candidate who is elected (presuming all 6 with a good chance are elected).

The following situation now occurs:

* If F's senator remains with Flux the control 1/6th of Flux resources ~> 1 senator.
* If F's senator defects but F remains in Flux, they still control 1/6th of resources ~> 5/6ths of a senator, **and** their senator ~> 1 + 5/6ths senators total.

Thus it is in F's interest for their senator to defect.
